Error Boundaries vs Tryâ€¦Catch?
Error Boundaries actually arenâ€™t in direct competition with tryâ€¦catch statements. Error Boundaries are only designed for intercepting errors that originate from 3 places in a React component:

During render phase
In a lifecycle method
In the constructor
Basicallyâ€¦ the React-y parts of a component. As a counterpoint, these are the places where Error Boundaries wonâ€™t be able to catch an error:

Event handlers (eg., onClick, onChange, etc.)
setTimeout or requestAnimationFramecallbacks
Server-side rendering (SSR)
And errors causesd by the error boundary itself (rather than its children)
So Error Boundaries donâ€™t really impact how you use tryâ€¦catch. Theyâ€™re both needed as a robust strategy for handling errors in React âš”ðŸ›¡
